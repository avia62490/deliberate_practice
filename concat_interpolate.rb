# 1. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string concatenation (the + operator).

# first = "sunny"
# last = "knee"
# puts "Hello, my name is " + first + " " + last

# 2. Write a program that uses variables to store a first and last name, then prints the full name in one line using string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# first = "sunny"
# last = "knee"
# puts "Hello, my name is #{first} #{last}"

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to input a word. If the word is "marco", print "polo".

# puts "enter a word:"
# word = gets.chomp
# if word == "marco"
#   p "polo"
# else
#   p "Hello, #{word}"
# end

# 4. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string concatenation (the + operator).

# color1 = "red"
# color2 = "yellow"
# color3 = "blue"
# puts "the 3 primary colors are " + color1 + ", " + color2 + ", and " + color3 

# 5. Write a program that uses variables to store three different colors, then prints out a sentence using the colors with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# color1 = "red"
# color2 = "yellow"
# color3 = "blue"
# puts "the 3 primary colors are #{color1}, #{color2}, and #{color3}."

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter a name. If the name is not "Santa", print "You're not Santa."

# puts "Enter a name: "
# name = gets.chomp
# if name == "Santa"
#   puts "I've been a bad boy ;)"
# else
#   puts "tell santa im baddd"
# end

# 7. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

# title = "Peace in Every Step"
# author = "Tich Nat Hanh"
# puts "I'm reading a book titled '" + title + "' written by " + author

# 8. Write a program that uses variables to store a book's title and author, then prints out a sentence using that information with string interpolation (the #{} operator).

# title = "The cat in the hat"
# author = "Dr. Seuss"
# puts "I like the book '#{title}' written by #{author}."

# 9. Write a program that asks the user to enter a password. If the password is "Joshua", the program responds "Shall we play a game?". For any other password, the program responds "Access denied"

# puts "enter the password: "
# password = gets.chomp
# if password == "Joshua"
#   puts "shall we play a game?"
# else
#   puts "Access denied!"
# end

# 10. Write a program that uses variables to store the names of three cities, then prints out a sentence using that information with string concatenation (the + operator).

city1 = "Chicago"
city2 = "London"
city3 = "Tokyo"
puts "they've been on tour in lots of cities around the world including " + city1 + ", " + city2 + ", and " + city3
